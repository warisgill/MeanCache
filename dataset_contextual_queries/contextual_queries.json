One of the primary causes was the stock market crash of October 1929, which wiped out millions of investors and led to a severe contraction in economic activity. Overproduction in agriculture and manufacturing led to falling prices and unsustainable debt levels. Banks failed in large numbers, leading to a loss of savings and further economic decline. The reduction in consumer spending and investment led to a steep decline in industrial output and employment. Trade policies, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, exacerbated the situation by reducing international trade. The Federal Reserve's monetary policies, which were not responsive to the crisis, also played a role. The global impact of the Great Depression was profound, leading to widespread poverty, unemployment, and political instability.",

Keynes argued that total spending in the economy (aggregate demand) is the primary driver of economic growth and employment. When aggregate demand is low, it can lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment and economic stagnation. Keynesians advocate for active government intervention to manage economic cycles. This includes using fiscal policy (government spending and taxation) to influence demand. For example, during a recession, Keynesians suggest that the government should increase spending and/or cut taxes to boost demand and stimulate economic growth. Conversely, during an economic boom, the government should cut spending and/or raise taxes to cool off inflation. Keynesians also believe in the importance of monetary policy (control of the money supply and interest rates) to manage the economy. Overall, Keynesian economics emphasizes the need for a mixed economy, where both the private sector and government play important roles.",

        "Main Query Response": "Cognitive dissonance, a concept developed by psychologist Leon Festinger in the 1950s, refers to the mental discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or attitudes simultaneously. This discomfort often leads to an alteration in one of the conflicting beliefs or behaviors to reduce the dissonance and achieve internal consistency. For example, if a person who values healthy living smokes cigarettes, they may experience cognitive dissonance because their behavior (smoking) conflicts with their belief (valuing health). To reduce this dissonance, the individual might change their behavior by quitting smoking, alter their belief by downplaying the health risks of smoking, or seek new information that supports their behavior (e.g., citing a relative who smoked and lived a long life). Cognitive dissonance is a powerful motivator for behavior change and can influence decision-making, attitude change, and the justification of actions. It has wide-ranging implications in areas such as marketing, politics, and interpersonal relationships, where people strive to maintain a consistent and positive self-image.",
        "Follow-Up Query": "How can cognitive dissonance influence decision-making?",

        "Main Query Response": "Supply and demand are fundamental concepts in economics that describe the relationship between the availability of a good or service and the desire for that good or service. The law of demand states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases, and as the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases. Conversely, the law of supply states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied increases, and as the price decreases, the quantity supplied decreases. The interaction of supply and demand determines the market equilibrium price, where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. Shifts in supply or demand can lead to changes in equilibrium price and quantity. For example, an increase in demand with constant supply will raise the equilibrium price and quantity, while an increase in supply with constant demand will lower the equilibrium price and increase the quantity. Understanding supply and demand helps explain price movements and market dynamics in various economic contexts.",
