This theory introduced concepts such as time dilation and length contraction. General relativity, published in 1915, extends these ideas to include gravity as a property of the curvature of spacetime.

In prometaphase, the nuclear envelope breaks down completely, and spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of chromosomes. Metaphase is characterized by chromosomes aligning at the metaphase plate. Anaphase involves the separation of sister chromatids, which are pulled to opposite poles of the cell. In telophase, the chromosomes de-condense, and nuclear envelopes reform around the two sets of chromosomes. Cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, follows to complete the process.",

Main causes include demand-pull inflation, where demand for goods and services exceeds supply, leading to higher prices. Cost-push inflation occurs when the costs of production increase, causing producers to raise prices. Built-in inflation results from adaptive expectations, where workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising living costs, leading to higher production costs and prices. Other factors include monetary policies, such as excessive money supply growth, and external factors like supply chain disruptions and changes in commodity prices. Understanding these causes is crucial for implementing effective inflation control measures.",

        "Main Query": "What are the principles of Keynesian economics?",
        "Main Query Response": "Keynesian economics, developed by John Maynard Keynes, emphasizes the role of government intervention in stabilizing the economy and managing demand to achieve full employment and economic growth. Key principles include the belief that aggregate demand drives economic performance, and during periods of recession, government spending should increase to boost demand and pull the economy out of a downturn. Conversely, during periods of inflation, government spending should decrease to cool down the economy. Keynesian economics also supports the use of fiscal policy, such as tax cuts and public spending, to influence economic activity. This theory has significantly influenced modern macroeconomic policy.",

        "Main Query": "What are the main components of the human nervous system?",
        "Main Query Response": "The human nervous system consists of two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord, which process and interpret sensory information and send out instructions. The PNS consists of all the nerves outside the CNS and is further divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary movements and transmits sensory information, and the autonomic nervous system, which regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiratory rate. The autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, which work together to maintain homeostasis.",
        "Follow-Up Query": "What is the role of the autonomic nervous system?",
        "Follow Up Query Response": "The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiratory rate and is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems."
